Indian National Congress will destroy the country. That is true. Why? Because we do not have a strong opposition and we will not have a strong opposition till we have Gandhi family at the top.

Rahul Gandhi is a sidelined politician in India who does not have mass following outside of some “Chamchas” in Congress. I think Congress realizes that, but for reason unknown, do not act. 

If Congress has to survive, get rid of Gandhi. I remember in 1990s Congress gave a slogan, “Soniya Lao, Desh Bachao!” Let’s change it to - “Rahul Gandhi Hatao, Desh Bachao!”

If Rahul Gandhi remains at the top of Congress, there will be no formidable opposition to Modi and BJP. Without a great opposition, there cannot be a great government and thus a threat to having and protecting a great democracy.
